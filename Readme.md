A simple state machine
======================

This project is a learning experience about how to implement a simple state machine.
I don't assume this code to be helpful to anyone else, but if you really think, you
can use it, go ahead and fork it.

## Getting Started

Welcome to this prototype! I prepared some easy instructions that hopefully are
helpful to you to get started.

### Prerequisites

I tested this prototype with the 64bit edition of [Godot 3.1](https://godotengine.org/) 
on Ubuntu 18.04. 

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

Clone the repository and open the project in Godot.

## Deployment

Feel free to use Godot Deployment to build and deploy an executable.

## Built With
